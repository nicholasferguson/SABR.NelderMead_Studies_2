# SABR. This study illustrates how SABR, alpha beta rho nu, is solved using NelderMead 
# This was a test case to work with SABR and NelderMead.

+ This C++ app does not require any external libraries.  It does read in data from an excel s/h.
+ It is built with Visual C++ 2017 Community Edition. x64.  Only debug mode has been tested.

+ It has two SABR related computations in function: SABR_BlackVol_InitialAlpha
	+ 'Obloj2008'  Method in Obloj 2008
	+ 'hagan2002'  Original Hagan's method in Hagan et. al. 2002
+ This SABR model does an initial fit of beta rho nu using method of a local calibration algorithm.  
+ It has a '/doc' subdirectory with related pdfs embedded in spreadsheet, plus a few more.
+ It has an excel interface, to read in parameter data from a spreadsheet, needed for C++ calculations.

# Original VB code by Changwei Xiong. 
+ http://www.cs.utah.edu/~cxiong/

+ This C++ console app ported his VB code over to C++.
+ His Excel spreadshet is titled "Swaption_Volatility_SABR_Calibration.xls" See his worksheet titled "Copyright and Disclaimer"  
+ This C++ console app reads in data from his spreadsheet.  Then duplicates computations found on his worksheet 'SABR(Implied Alpha)'
+ This C++ console app has output that can be compared to Changwei Xiong's spreadsheet output on worksheet 'SABR(Implied Alpha)'

# Issues
	+ This code needs some cleanup. It was meant as a quick study.
	+ Excel s/h was tested with Excel 2007 on Windows 10 Business
	+ Excel s/h do not close if app is interrupted during debug.
	+ Excel s/h is not that stable, with this xlsread....
	+ Excel s/h has two addins:
		+ Solver
			+ If problems, google, how delete this Addin and then reinstall.
		+ EDate for 2007 is available via Analysis Tool Pack Add for Excel 2007,
	+ Decimal accuracy between Excel and C++ is off...not sure why.
	+ This app does not yet promise to always close excel s/h.  This has to be reviewed.
		+ If run of this app is interrupted, an excel s/h will not be cleaned up.  Have to add some code.
	
# To run: 
+ Swaption_Volatility_SABR_Calibration.xls MUST BE CLOSED.
+ Verify that this line is in 'Command Arguments" passed to app via VS properties, in debug mode.
$(ProjectDir)Swaption_Volatility_SABR_Calibration.xls
+ If that has problems then uncomment line in main, and type in your path to that s/h.
   +  	//wchar_t* XLSPATH = L"H:\\github\\workdir.2018\\SABR.NelderMead_Studies_2\\Swaption_Volatility_SABR_Calibration.xls";
   +  and comment out this line:
   +  wchar_t* XLSPATH = (wchar_t*)argv[1];
